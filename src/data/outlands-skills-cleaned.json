Poison Sting damage itself will not cause an interrupt to the target, but the normal interrupt handling for the Poison Spell will be in place as before (i.e. normal handling for being a 3rd circle offensive spell). The Poison Sting mechanic will apply when casting the spell onto both creatures and players.\n\n\n\n==Poison Stacking==\n* Every non-tamed/non-summoned creature can now have multiple Poison effects stacked on them, with the following rules:\n* Creatures will only ever have one Poison Type active on them at a time (i.e Lesser, Regular, Greater, Deadly, Lethal)\n* Each Player is allowed to apply poison onto an already poisoned creature so long as it is the same poison level\n* Each Player is also allowed to have one of their followers apply Poison onto an already poisoned creature so long as it is the same poison level\n* If a Player or Player Follower applies a higher level poison than what is currently on a creature, it will clear out the poison of all other players/followers currently stacked on it\n* Poisoned creatures will track individual Tick Count Remaining amounts for each player/creature that poisoned it (which starts at Tick 0 and ends at Tick 10)\n* A poisoned creature will use a single timer to resolve all Poison Ticks at the same time (i.e. every 5 seconds a Lethal Poisoned creature will resolve multiple creature/player poison ticks on it at once)\n* A creature will be considered Poisoned, and have a Green status health bar, so long as any creature/player has any Poison Ticks remaining on it\n* Any bonuses players/followers have towards increasing Poison Damage or boosting Poison Effects will only apply to their own individual Poison Ticks resolving (i.e. all players don't get a bonus to Poison Damage on a creature due to a single player using Mind Rot or having Poison Mastery Chain Links/Aspect)\n\n\n\n==Poison Text Visuals==\n===Creature Poison Single Click===\n* Players can toggle whether to display single-click overhead Poison text for creatures by typing [SingleClickPoisonTicks or by navigating to Paperdoll -> Help -> Commands -> Mechanics -> SingleClickPoisonTicks\n* Players can see what Type of Poison they individually have on a creature as well as how many Poison Ticks they have remaining on the creature by single-clicking or doing All Names\n[[File:poisontick1.png|link=]]\n\n* If a creature is currently poisoned, but the player themselves doesn't have any poison applied on the target, single-clicking the creature or doing All Names will simply display what type of Poison is currently active on it (i.e poison from other players/creatures)\n[[File:poisontick2.png|link=]]\n\n===Creature Poison Overhead Messages===\n* In order to reduce the amount of overhead text spam related to the new poison stacking mechanics, some changes have been made to overhead text messages derived from Poison for creatures\n\n====Applying Poison====\n* When Poison is applied to a creature, it will only display the \"Creature X is wracked in extreme pain\"-type message overhead to the player who applied the Poison\n* Tamed/Summoned Creatures that become poisoned, however, will always still display these messages to their controller\n\n====Resolving Poison Ticks====\n* The \"Creature X is wracked in extreme pain\"-type message that occurs when resolving Poison Ticks for creatures will now only display to players who have poison active on the creature\n* Tamed/Summoned Creatures that are poisoned, however, will always still display these messages to their controller\n[[File:poisontick3.png|link=]]\n\n====Creature Poison Overriding====\n* If another player or creature applies a Higher level of Poison than what is currently on the target, all other players who previously had a lower level Poison effect active on the creature will see a \"*poison overridden*\" message displayed above the creature for them (indicating their Poison on the creature has now been wiped out)\n[[File:poisontick4.png|link=]]\n\n====Creature Poison Tick Completion====\n* When a player's 10th (Final) Poison Tick resolves on a creature, they will see a \"'''*poison complete*'''\" message displayed over the creature (indicating their poison effect has ended on the creature)\n[[File:poisontick5.png|link=]]\n\n\n\n==Training==\n* Poisoning wont raise faster on Shelter Islands/Newplayer Dungeon\n* Train the skill by applying the skill-appropiate Poison to a bladed weapon\n* Roughly 100 Poison potions for 50 - 60 skill\n* Roughly 750 Greater Poison potions for 60 - 80 skill\n* Roughly 1100 Deadly Poison Potions for 80 - 100 skill\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

A common method to tame a hostile pet is to tell another pet to attack it, then for it to stop (all stop, or (petname) stop) you will then be able to make taming attempts, however you will need to heal your pet being attacking periodically.\n\nIt is also possible to have a number of pets with you GREATER than the number of control slots (eg. You have 5 control slots filled and you tame another creature) however once this occurs the only orders you will be able to give to them are to  follow you, until you are at or under your max number of control slots again.\n\n==Abandoned and Released Pets==\n* In order for a pet to not \"become abandoned\" they must have their Tamer approach them within Speech distance at least once every 24 hours\n* If players are in game for 24 hours (i.e. not logging out) and away (more than speech distance) from their pets for a long period of time, we recommend they either use the Stables for them, or return to their pets to \"refresh\" their abandonment timer\n* When a player releases a tamed creature, they will no longer be Pacified for 60 minutes, and will now instead be Hindered for 60 minutes until retamed by a player\n* Recently released creatures that are Hindered will have a \"*released*\" text above their head\n* Visit the Prevalia or Corpse Creek Stables or the Prevalia Zoo and speak to the [[Animal Wrangler]] to recover abandoned pets\n\n[[File:wikitamingrelease.jpg|link=]]\n\n\n==Stables and Control Slots==\n* Players can speak with a [[Stablemaster]] to view their Stables\n* A ridable pet does not contribute to your Control Slots tally whilst mounted.

A tamed ember drake has a 6% chance to trigger a Flamestrike against a player.\n* Tamed/Summoned followers now have a 25% reduced chance in PvP to use a special ability when attacking a player (previously was 40% reduction)\n* Tamed/Summoned follower ability cooldowns in PvP are now only increased by 50% (previously were increased by 100%)\n\n\n==Tamed/Summoned Creatures PvP Damage Caps==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

The player then creates their \"Poison Dexxer\" template by reworking their current character's skills (through normal skill gain and dropping unwanted skills) to the desired amounts. In the image below, the player has Poisoning, Magery, and Magic Resist on both their current character and their Echo, but their current character has dropped Spirit Speak, Taste Id, Wrestling, and Meditation and in exchange for Fencing, Tactics, Healing, and Anatomy.

Players can acquire Books of Chivalry in various ways:\n\n* Players who select Chivalry skill on Character Creation will start with a Book of Chivalry in their backpack\n* From Paladin NPCs by spending 5,000 Gold or sacrificing 25,000 Fame\n** Players can speak to Paladin NPCs in various towns by saying \"Paladin\", \"Chivalry\", or \"Book\" out loud near them\n** Players can Train up to 50 Chivalry skill at a Paladin NPC in the normal method of training any skill from an NPC\n* Players who have a Book of Chivalry in their backpack will automatically gain Chivalry skill while making Melee attacks, similar to gaining Tactics skill\n* Players can reach 101-120 Chivalry skill through use of Skill Scrolls\n* Epic Skill Scrolls increase the Skill Cap of the Chivalry skill\n* '''Chivalry requires Tactics skill:''' A player's effective Chivalry skill is capped by their Tactics skill (but can go above 100 Chivalry freely if they have 100 Tactics)\n* Mini-Bosses, Bosses, and Omni-Bosses no longer drop Books of Chivalry as loot\n\n\n[[File:chivalrypurchase1.png|link=]]\n\n\n==Chivalry Menu==\n* If a player has a Book of Chivalry in their backpack, they can open the Chivalry Menu by double-clicking it or typing [Chivalry\n* In the Chivalry Menu, players can click on Ability Icons to see a description for each ability, including the ability's Holy Symbol Cost and Minimum Chivalry Skill needed to activate it\n* Players can see how many Holy Symbols they currently have banked up and are available to spend in the middle of the menu\n* Players can click the \"Activate Ability\" button to attempt to activate the currently selected ability (provided they have sufficient Holy Symbols, enough Chivalry skill, and the ability is not in cooldown)\n\n\n[[File:chivalrybookgump.jpg|link=]]\n\n\n\n==Chivalry Hotbar==\n* Players can launch a Chivalry Hotbar by clicking the \"Open Hotbar\" button in the Chivalry Menu or by typing

enough Holy Symbols available to activate it\n* Chivalry Ability Icons are displayed in <u>Light Grey</u> if the player does not have enough Holy Symbols available to use it\n* Chivalry Ability Icons are displayed in <u>Dark Grey</u> if the player has recently activated the ability and it is currently in its 30 second cooldown\n* Chivalry Ability Icons are displayed in <u>Red</u> if the player does not meet the skill requirements to use the ability\n\n[[File:chivalryhotbarstatus.jpg|link=]]\n\n\n===Layout Switching===\n* The small Orb Button at the top of the Chivalry Hotbar allows players to rotate through a variety of different visual layouts for the hotbar including switching between full/condensed mode, vertical/horizontal orientation, single/double rows, or minimalist mode (no icons and only symbol count shown)\n\n[[File:chivalryhotbarlayouts.gif|link=]]\n\n===Ability Auto-Renew===\n* Many abilities in the hotbar have a \"Auto-Renew\" checkbox button next to them, that when toggled, will automatically attempt to activate the ability for the player whenever possible, provided they have enough Symbols available to pay for the ability\n* If a player has multiple abilities set to Auto-Renew, it will try to activate the least expensive ones first (i.e. progresses from top to bottom)\n* Chivalry Abilities will not attempt to Auto-Renew if the player has been out of combat for more than 30 seconds\n\n[[File:chivalryhotbarautorenew.jpg|link=]]\n\n\n===Save Hotbar on logout===\n* For quick save of the necromancery hotbar position user can used <code>-savechivbar</code>

the Paperdoll -> Help -> Commands -> Chivalry section of the Commands Menu or [[Commands#Chivalry|here on the wiki]]\n* Each individual Chivalry Ability has its own [Command such as [ConsecrateWeapon or [CloseWounds that when typed will attempt to activate the ability\n* Players can also use [Chivalry1 [Chivalry2 [Chivalry3 and so on to activate Chivalry Abilties, where the number refers to the ability's position in the Chivalry Hotbar\n\n==Chivalry in PvP==\n* Chivalry Abilities will NOT work in PvP\n* Players may be able to activate certain abilities in PvP, but their effects will NOT apply to the player while they are currently flagged as being in PvP\n* Instead, having the Chivalry skill during PvP will provide the player with a (10% * (Chivalry Skill / 100)) Supplemental PvP Melee Damage bonus similar to our handling for the Camping, Forensics, Tracking, Lumberjacking, and Mining skills in PvP\n* Abilities that heal other targets, such as Noble Sacrifice or Holy Light, will not providing healing to the target if the target has been flagged as being in PvP\n* Players will be able to accumulate Holy symbols while flagged in PvP\n* Players will be able to activate all Chivalry abilities while flagged in PvP with the exception of Sacred Journey (which still requires the player to have not been in any form of recent PvP within 2 minutes or any combat of any kind within 30 seconds)\n* Players will still not be able to heal targets via the Noble Sacrifice or Holy Light abilities if the target has recently been in PvP\n** Reminder: Individual Chivalry abilities do NOT give bonuses to players in PvP, and players instead receive a flat (10% * (Chivalry / 100)) Supplemental PvP Melee Damage bonus from the Chivalry skill in PvP\n\n\n==Chivalry Ability Descriptions==\nThe list below outlines each Chivalry Ability including its Name, Holy Symbol Cost, Minimum Chivalry Skill Requirement, Ability Icon, and a Description of the ability:\n\n{{Chivalry}}\n\n===Sacred Journey===\n* The Damage bonus from Sacred Journey will apply to players so long as they remain within 50 tiles of the creator of the Holy Gate (similar to our current buff handing for Bard Songs, Artisan Aspect Buffs, etc)\n* Players have the option to set a Custom location for their Sacred Journey ability in addition to the exiting options for Town/Dungeon/Shrine locations\n** Players can set their Custom location by clicking the Set Custom button in the Sacred Journey menu\n** Players can only set Custom locations that would be considered valid Recall/Gate Travel locations\n** Players can override an existing Custom location by clicking the Set Custom button again\n** Activating the Sacred Journey ability and selecting the Custom location will create a standard Gate Travel Moongate that follows all the normal rules for using a Gate Travel Moongate (although visually will look like a Sacred Journey gate\n* Players can single-click a Sacred Journey Moongate to see the coordinates of the destination\n\n\n[[File:chivalrysacredjourneygump1.jpg|link=]]\n\n[[File:chivalrysacredjourneygump2.jpg|link=]]\n\n\n\n==Effective Chivalry Skill==\n* Each Chivalry Ability has a Minimum Chivalry Skill requirement that must be met in order to activate the ability\n* As mentioned prior, a player's Chivalry Skill is also capped based on Tactics, so a player with 80 Chivalry and 60 Tactics will only be considered to have 60 Chivalry Skill (and therefore could not activate the Consecrate Weapon ability which takes 65 Chivalry)\n* Once a player reaches 100 Tactics, they can go above 100 Chivalry freely (using Skill Scrolls to increase their Chivalry Skill Cap from 101 to 120 as normal)\n* As noted in the descriptions for Chivalry Abilities in the image above, each Chivalry Ability scales in effectiveness and power based on the player's Effective Chivalry skill\n* Players are able to increase their Effective Chivalry Skill through other sources, most notably Holy Aspect Armor (explained below)\n* Any bonuses players gain to Effective Chivalry Skill will increase the power of their Chivalry Abilities, but will NOT count towards them meeting the Skill Requirement of those abilities: players must have both printed Chivalry and Tactics skill matching or exceeding the requirement of the ability in order to activate it\n\n\n==Max Symbol Capacity==\n* A player's '''Max Holy Symbol Capacity''' for Chivalry is now '''(Effective Chivalry Skill / 10)''' Rounded down\n\n\n==Training==\nPlayers will only gain Chivalry skill if they have a Book of Chivalry in their inventory.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!
